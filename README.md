# 1M Linear/Paged RAM/ROM
## One RC2014 memory card to rule them all!

This board combines the best features of currently available RC2014 memory boards in one:

- One 512K memory chip which can be RAM or ROM (selected with 3 jumpers)
- One 512K RAM chip
- Select between linear and paged memory using a single jumper
- Select between linear and paged memory in software (from Z80 or BusRaider)
- Support for the PAGE pin on the RC2014 bus (with an optional pull-up selected via a jumper)

Plays nicely with the BusRaider.
